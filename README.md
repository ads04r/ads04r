Hello, I'm Ash. I write code for fun, and for my job, and I just have one Github account for both, so please don't take anything in here seriously.

I generally don't write unit tests, most of my code isn't commented and I often edit code on, and push from, a production server. Frankly, I'm an awful software developer. But my code (mostly) runs, so I guess that makes me a pretty good hacker.
