Hello, I'm Ash. I write code for fun, and for my job, and I just have one Github account for both.

* I generally don't write unit tests
* Most of my code isn't commented
* I often edit code on, and push from, a production server

Frankly, I'm an awful software developer. But my code (mostly) runs, and that's the main thing.
